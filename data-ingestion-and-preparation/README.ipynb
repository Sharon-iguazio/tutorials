    "Various steps of the data science life cycle (pipeline) might require different tools and frameworks for working with data, especially when it comes to the different mechanisms required during the research and development phase versus the operational production phase.\n",
    "The platform features a wide set of methods for manipulating and managing data, of different formats, in each step of the data life cycle, using a variety of frameworks, tools, and API &mdash; such as Spark SQL and DataFrames, Spark Streaming, Presto SQL queries, pandas DataFrames, Dask, the V3IO Frames Python library, and web APIs\n",

    "### Platform Data Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is stored within data containers in the platform's distributed file system (DFS).\n",
    "All platform clusters have two predefined containers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <a id=\"default-container\"></a> The default **\"bigdata\"** container.\n",
    "- <a id=\"users-container\"></a>The **\"users\"** container, which is designed to contain **&lt;username&gt;** directories that provide individual development environments for storing user-specific data.\n",
    "  The platform's Jupyter Notebook, Zeppelin, and web-based shell \"command-line services\" automatically create such a directory for the running user of the service and set it as the home directory of the service environment.\n",
    "  You can leverage the following environment variables, which are predefined in the platform's command-line services, to access this running-user directory from your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `V3IO_USERNAME` &mdash; set to the username of the running user of the Jupyter Notebook service.\n",
    "  - `V3IO_HOME` &mdash; set to the running-user directory in the \"users\" container &mdash; **users/&lt;running user&gt;**.\n",
    "  - `V3IO_HOME_URL` &mdash; set to the fully qualified `v3io` path to the running-user directory &mdash; `v3io://users/<running user>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data containers and their contents are referenced differently depending on the programming interface.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In local file-system (FS) commands you use the predefined `v3io` root data mount &mdash; `/v3io/<container name>[/<data path>]`.\n",
    "  There's also a predefined local-FS `User` mount to the **users/&lt;running user&gt;** directory, and you can use the aforementioned environment variables when setting data paths.\n",
    "  For example, `/v3io/users/$V3IO_USERNAME`, `/v3io/$V3IO_HOME`, and `/User` are all valid ways of referencing the **users/&lt;running user&gt;** directory from a local FS command.\n",
    "- In Hadoop FS or Spark DataFrame commands you use a fully qualified path of the format `v3io://<container name>/<data path>`.\n",
    "  You can also use environment variables with these interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "For detailed information and examples on how to set the data path for each interface, see [Setting Data Paths](https://www.iguazio.com/docs/latest-release/tutorials/getting-started/fundamentals/#data-paths) and the examples in the platform's tutorial Jupyter notebooks."
